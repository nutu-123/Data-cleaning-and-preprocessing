# Data-cleaning-and-preprocessing 

This mini project is all about cleaning and preparing raw data for machine learning models. Real-world data is often messy â€” it can have missing values, text data, and outliers. In this project, we fix these problems step by step.
We start by checking the dataset and handling missing values using mean and mode. Then, we convert categorical columns into numbers using one-hot encoding. After that, we normalize all numeric columns so the data is on the same scale. We also use boxplots to find and remove outliers from the data.
The final cleaned dataset is saved as a new CSV file, ready to be used for any machine learning project. This project uses simple Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
